British-Airways-Virtual-Internship - The Forage

Disclaimer: I got this virtual internship from the theforage.com website

In this virtual internship, I was given 2 task's.

Task 1
Web scraping and analysis
This Jupyter notebook includes some code to get you started with web scraping. We will use a package called BeautifulSoup to collect the data from the web. Once you've collected your data and saved it into a local .csv file you should start with your analysis.
